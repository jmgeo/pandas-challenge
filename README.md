DATA ANALYSIS

After completing the coding portion of the exercise and analysizing the outputs, we can definitively conclude the following:

Heroes of Pymoli is a game overwhelmingly played by men in their 20s.
Analysis of available gender data indicates that over 84% of players identify as male.
Analysis of available age data indicates that over 58% of players are in their 20s.

Players who identify as male account for the vast majority of items sales in the game. 
Male players purchased 652 items for a total of $1967.64 in sales.

However, players who identify as female or other/non-disclosed spend more per item and more on average than male players.
Females spend ~18 cents more per item on average than their male counterparts, and ~40 cents more per purchase on average.
Other/Non-Disclosed spend ~33 cente more pre purchase on average than their male counterparts, and ~50 cents more per purchase on average.
(Note: I did have trouble generating the Avg Total Purchase Per Person result in code, and am relying on the results from the example for this conclusion).
